# spanning-forests
This class is designed to find the number of spanning forests within a graph. 
Within a product graph, you can test for independence between certain projections (given a spanning forest). 
See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0896.pdf for more details on how the projection is defined.
Runs fairly poorly because of the memory required while finding the spanning forests.
